## Number Guessing Game

Your game starts by asking the player for a maximum number, then generates a random number using that input. <br>

The player keeps guessing until they either find the correct number or type "q" to quit, with hints like “Too high,” “Too low,” or “Close!” if within 3 numbers.<br>

It counts the number of attempts and congratulates the player when they guess correctly.<br>
